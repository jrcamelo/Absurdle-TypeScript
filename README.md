# ðŸ”§ Environment Variables
Create a `.env.development.local` and follow the variable names based on `.env.TEMPLATE`.  

### Set the Database
This project utilizes [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database, with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as the ORM.  
Set `DB_CONN_STRING` pointing to your MongoDB instance.  
You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/) to create a free MongoDB instance.  

### Set the Seeds
The `DAILY_SEED` will randomize the list of answers.  
`VALID_WORDS_SEED` will randomize the codes generated for sharing games.  
The seeds can be any random string, so go ahead and change them to something else.  

# ðŸš€ Start the project
Install the dependencies with `yarn`.  
Then start the project with `yarn run dev`

## Unit Tests
This project uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) as the testing framework.  
Run the tests with `yarn run test`.  
I recommend the following [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions to tests easily:  
- [Jasmine Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-jasmine-test-adapter)  
- [Jasmine Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DmitriyMuraviov.vscode-jasmine-test-runner)

## Lint
Lint the code with `yarn run lint` or `yarn run lint-fix`.  
Configure the rules by editing `.eslintrc`.  
Linting also runs on every pull request with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).


# ðŸ“¦ Deployment
You can deploy easily by using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
